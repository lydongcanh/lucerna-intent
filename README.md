# Lucerna Intent

[![Build Status](https://github.com/lydongcanh/lucerna-intent/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lydongcanh/lucerna-intent/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A companion service for [Lucerna](https://github.com/lydongcanh/lucerna) that classifies user messages into feature intents. 
Designed for compliance-safe analytics, no raw text is stored, only intent labels and metadata.
